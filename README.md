# Project React Native App ðŸ“±
This week I built my first App with React native. I used a Accelerometersensor to change content in a magic 8-ball when shaking it, For one off the balls I used a API and for the other balls i made my own Arrays and picked a random answer. I used Animation Api, Lottie animation and styled components. 


I had problem when I was going to publish but then I saw that I should write my Expo username and Expo password in the Terminal so then it worked corectly.
